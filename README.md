**üî¥ Notice:** Windows Insider Program requires telemetry to be set to *Full*.
After enrolling your machine to the *Windows Insider Program* please make sure
that your diagnostic data collection settings are set to *Full*. Some *Insider
Preview* builds may not get offered in *Windows Update* if you do not have
correct telemetry settings. You can verify or modify your telemetry settings in
*Settings* > *Privacy* > *Diagnostics & feedback*.

## ‚ö° Restore to default
To restore *Windows Insider Program* to default settings<br>
just choose `Unenroll Insider Preview` in InsiderSwitch.<br>
You will get prompted to reboot, press Y and then enter.<br>

## üß≠ How it works
This program takes advantage of undocumented `TestFlags` registry value.
If this value is set to `0x20`, all access to online *Windows Insider* services
gets disabled. Because of this, we can set our own *Windows Insider Preview*
configuration without being overriden by the contact to the service. Since
Windows Update does not check if machine is actually enrolled to the program,
you will get offered *Insider Preview* builds by just setting correct values in registry.
